  <h1> Humara Patna </h1>
  <p>In the heart of Bihar, where ancient whispers still echo through the streets, lies a city that has watched the world change for over two millennia. Once the jewel of the Maurya and Gupta empires, Pataliputra stood proudly, its name synonymous with grandeur across the great cities of Asia. Now known as Patna, it’s a tapestry of time where history and modernity intertwine along the sacred Ganges.

    West Patna, with its British colonial legacy, boasts stately mansions and solemn administrative edifices, standing as silent sentinels to a bygone era of order and elegance. Venture east and you’ll find yourself in the old city’s embrace—a labyrinth of narrow lanes, where every turn reveals a piece of history, from medieval monuments to the vibrant chaos of the bazaars, alive with the spirit of centuries.This city, a living museum, breathes the legacy of empires while pulsing to the rhythm of contemporary life—a place where the past is not just remembered, but relived every day. The capital of Bihar is a modern city with ancient roots going back to 600 BC. During the reign of the Maurya and Gupta empires, then known as Pataliputra, was renowned as one of the great cities of Asia, but today it is a congested urban sprawl, stretching along the banks of the Ganges. West Patna, laid out by the British, has gracious mansions and administrative buildings, while the eastern end comprises the old city, a warren of crowded lanes surrounding medieval monuments and bustling bazaars.</p>
